# Demonstrate placement algorithm

## Tool Requirements

- OpenShift CLI Version >= 4.3.0<br>_Needed for kustomize_

```bash
oc version
```

## This example, allows you to demonstrate moving an application from one cluster to another

### Activate a subscription (ONLY RUN ONCE)

1. Add the subscription to your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes HUB

```
clone https://github.com/open-cluster-management/demo-subscription-gitops.git
oc apply -k demo-subscription-gitops/placement/subscription/
```

### Using

- Navigate to the Manage applications in the UI. Click the `nginx-placement` Application name.
- View the Topology, look around, by default the application should have deployed to `vendor: OpenShift` clusters
- Click the `Resources` tab
- Edit the placement rule, and change `vendor: OpenShift` to `cloud: Amazon` and your application will be migrated to any cluster with the `cloud: Amazon` label. You need to adjust this key and value pair, based on what is seen in your Cluster List page as available labels
- To spread the app to all clusters, change the YAML as follows:

```yaml
clusterSelector:
  matchLabels: {}
```
